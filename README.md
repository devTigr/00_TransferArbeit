Final Release for Prod. 
This Version is not just another release. It's our final Release, marking a significant milestone in our project. 

To Test our build, you can clone this [Repo](https://github.com/dio-it/test_repo_p_and_d_systems).

1. After that, change the directory into the test folder where the docker-compose.yml file is and start it with docker-compose. 
`docker-compose -f  docker-compose.yml up -d'
2. Wait 2 Minutes until all connections and the Database Cluster are up and running, and visit http://localhost:3000.
Depending on your System, this can go faster or longer, and this will show you an error like this:

Wait 1 Minute more and check again.
